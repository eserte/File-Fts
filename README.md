# File::Fts

A simple wrapper around fts as found on Linux and BSD systems.
This can be used as an alternative to File::Find.

There's no documentation yet â€” refer to test.pl for sample usage.

Note that even the module name is not fixed --- it could be File::FTS
in the end, or maybe File::FTS::XS (as there used a File::FTS in the
CPAN, but this is vanished by now; see https://github.com/gitpan/File-FTS)
